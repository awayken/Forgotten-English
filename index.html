        <ul class="quotations">
            <li>
                To fatten, or grow fat. In Sternberg's <em>Folk Lore and Glossary of Northamptonshire</em> [1851], the local phrase is quoted, &ldquo;Them pigs <em>batten</em> in the sun.&rdquo;
                <cite>Charles Mackkay's <em>Lost Beauties of the English Language</em>,&nbsp;1874</cite>
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Fattening and battening</em>, a toast of a child's fattening and thriving given at its baptism in private, when the bread, cheese and whisky are partaken of.
                <cite>Alexander Warrack's <em>Scots Dialect Dictionary</em>,&nbsp;1911</cite>

            Feast Day of John the Baptist<br />
            John Brand wrote in his <em>Observations on Popular Antiquities</em> (1900): "It seems to have been the custom at christening entertainments not only for the guests to eat as much as they pleased, but also to carry away as much as they liked in their pockets." And in <em>The Batchellor's Banquet</em> (1677) we read, "What store of sugar, briskets, comphets, and caraways, marmalet, and marchpane, with all kind of superflous banquetting stuff...which at that time must fill the pockets of dainty dames." But over time, christening ceremonies declined. In 1666 Thomas Shipman noted the flagging generosity of godparents, who once bestowed silver gifts:<br />
            <blockquote>
                Formerly, when they us'd to troul [give]<br />
                Gilt bowls of sack, they gave the bowl<br />
                Two spoons at least, an ill use kept;<br />
                'Tis well if now our own be left.
            </blockquote>
